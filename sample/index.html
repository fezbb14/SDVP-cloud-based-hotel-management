    <h1 class="titles">Our Story</h1>
<div class="infoL">

  <p>Petra Flamingo Getaway Lodge is Australia’s one of the largest owner-operator of hotel rooms. This gives every guest a guarantee that 
  they are staying in the best accommodation in Australia.  Our hotels are award winning and have continually been ranked the best on many 
  traveller review websites. We invest heavily in continually updating our furnishings so our guests will enjoy the latest in design and comfort
  when staying in our lodge. For over 8-years Petra Flamingo has been the market leader in apartment style hotel accommodation, with convenient 
  location. We are also very excited to announce that Petra Flamingo will be opening up a brand new, luxury hotel in the heart of Melbourne.
  </p> <p>Enjoy more space than a typical hotel room, we offer separate bedrooms, lounge and living space for you to enjoy with that special someone,
  group of friends or the whole family as they comfortably sleep up to eight adults. Our studio and 1 bedroom suites sleep two adults, 2 bedroom
  suites sleep four adults and the 3 bedroom suites sleep six adults, compared with other hotels who only have small studio rooms. 
  For our hotels that offer both studio and 1 bedroom suite types, we suggest you book a 1 bedroom suite as a little extra cost gives you greater 
  value with a separate bedroom, living and dining space.</p><p>Our lodge include a residential sized, spacious gourmet kitchen – perfect to cook 
  your favourite meals whilst you’re travelling. Each of our kitchens has been architecturally designed and include European-style appliances including 
  a ducted range-hood, cooktop, oven, integrated microwave, dishwasher and a full-sized refrigerator. You will find all the essential cooking items and 
  utensils to make use of the residential-style kitchen, including a complete set of glassware, crockery and cookware.
  All suites have a flat screen HD TV’s in the Living area, as well as TVs in all bedrooms.</p>
